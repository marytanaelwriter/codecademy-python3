Are you in the mood for reading but not sure what to read?

I get the struggle.

This simple program, a guessing game and a book genre generator rolled into one, might help you decide.

The idea is simple: you have to guess a random number. Upon guessing correctly, you'll get your first genre.

For the second genre, you have to enter your favorite number.

The final result? You'll get two genres, and you can decide which book falls into those categories.

Hopefully, this will help narrow down your options.

Ready?

Let's get started!
